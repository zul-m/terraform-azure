## Prerequisites

1. Install Terraform and git (optional) on your local environment.
2. Find your Azure subscription:
    - Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
    - Under the Azure services heading, select Subscriptions. If you don't see Subscriptions here, use the search box to find it.
    - Find the Subscription ID for the subscription shown in the second column. If no subscriptions appear, or you don't see the right one, you may need to [switch directories](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-portal/set-preferences#switch-and-manage-directories) to show the subscriptions from a different Azure AD tenant.
    - Copy the Subscription ID. You can paste this value into a text document or other location.
    - You can also list your subscriptions and view their IDs programmatically by using [Get-AzSubscription](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/az.accounts/get-azsubscription?view=latest&preserve-view=true) (Azure PowerShell) or [az account list](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/account?view=azure-cli-latest&preserve-view=true) (Azure CLI).
3. Find your Azure AD tenant:
    - Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
    - Confirm that you are signed into the tenant for which you want to retrieve the ID. If not, [switch directories](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-portal/set-preferences#switch-and-manage-directories) so that you're working in the right tenant.
    - Under the Azure services heading, select Azure Active Directory. If you don't see Azure Active Directory here, use the search box to find it.
    - Find the Tenant ID in the Basic information section of the Overview screen.
    - Copy the Tenant ID. You can paste this value into a text document or other location.
    - You can also find your tenant programmatically by using [Azure Powershell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-how-to-find-tenant#find-tenant-id-with-powershell) or [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-how-to-find-tenant#find-tenant-id-with-cli).
